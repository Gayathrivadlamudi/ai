express is framework for node
this helps in routing
builds apis
and handles requests and responses

const path=require("path") means it is built-in node js module we are importing it

path.join(__dirname, "public", "index.html")
path.join means it joins the folders safely
__dirname means it give the folder path  where current js file located

app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}));
this middleware converts the form url data to orginal 

i.e
URLs cannot accept spaces and special characters
so when we send the emails or passwords ,the browser changes them into another safe format
after the server recieves it and changes to original format
