why commits are fast in git
Git saves only what changed
when you commit 
if a file didnt changed then it doesnt create new data it uses the old data only
if a file changed,git saves only that content that is changed

suppose we have 100 files
and one file is changed
then git saves
1 new blob
1 new tree reference
1 new commit object
that's why git take milliseconds to save the big projects

if there are two files with same content then there will be only one blob points to the same contetnt
EXAMPLE
100644 blob 27562bc42c7a9db2cc8d4ffeb0e9ce3c20528f08    scaling copy.py
100644 blob 27562bc42c7a9db2cc8d4ffeb0e9ce3c20528f08    scaling.py

by using git checkout <commit hash code> we can revert the changes that we commited
this doesnt mean that the newly commited hash will be deleted the head now points to the commit we mentioned
A --- B --- C --- D   (main branch)
You are currently on D
main → D
HEAD → main

git checkout B

A --- B --- C --- D
      ↑
     HEAD
main ─────────────→ D

this is about git commands

first need to intilize the git
git init

then need to attach local git to remote git hub
git remote add origin "http"

then add the files to staged area
git add .

then we need to commit them
git commit -m "message about commiting"

then we need to push
git push origin main

if we create a git locally then we need to create empty rep in github
then we need to push

if we create a git remotely then first we need to pull the files from remote and
then push the files from local to remote
then push the files from local to remote

by using git log
we get the full history about
commit hash
author
Date
message what we committed

git log --oneline --graph
means
unlike above it doesnt give all information in just one line it gives
short commit hash and comit message
graph means it gives short cut info like
* means commit
|\ means branch change
| means branch continues
example

* b8b1cbb Adding allparts
*   485d65a Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/Gayathrivadlamudi/ai
|\
| * f83a49f Initial commit
* f42606a commiting week2 for 1


git show commithash
means it will show the changes we did last time and now
like
--- a/scikit/week2/RandomForest.py
+++ b/scikit/week2/RandomForest.py
-print("accuracy",accuracy_score(y_test,pred))
+print("accuracy is ",accuracy_score(y_test,pred))
git show is difference btw the commit and its parent commit

git diff commitA commitB
this give difference between these two commits only

Branching
when we want to create a new feature and try new things on code without disturbing the other code
we create a branch
at start both default and newly created branch will point to same commit
main -> c1
newBranch -> c1

git branch shows all the branches
to create a new branch
git branch branchName
or
git checkout -b branchName(to create a branch and switch to it)

to switch to new branch
git checkout branchName

after that if we push the new branch
again in we want same code as before we do
git checkout hashcode
and change the code and again we can push it

now we need to merge branch
we always should stand on branch and then we need to merge the new branch
git checkout branch
git branch
*main
then we need to do git merge feature
if we change the same file same line in both branches then we get confilts
git confuses which content to take
so first we remove those line >> ---- like that
and we add and commit and push the file after again
we merge those branches

git rever head

this is wrong file
now we commited this but we want to deleted this comit
then we do revert head
then it deletes the present head hash
and then creates a new commit hash which points to previous one

git restore file.txt means
suppose we changed the file content
but we didnt do any commit so if we want previioud contetnt
then we use git restore file.txt
