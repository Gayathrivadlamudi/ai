scikit is a machine learning library and by using this library we can build and test machine learning models
scikit is like a toolbox
and inside it have multiple packages
✅ scikit-learn = sklearn
They are just two names for the same library.
scikit-learn → the official name (used for installation and documentation)
sklearn → the import name (used inside your Python code)

where by using this we can
load and manage data that is we no need to downalod the data inside this library we will have data

🧹 Clean and prepare your data

🤖 Train different types of machine learning models

📈 Check how good your model is

Scikit-learn gives you small datasets already inside the library, like:

load_iris() — flower data 🌸

load_digits() — handwritten numbers ✍️

load_diabetes() — health data 🧬

load_wine() — wine quality 🍷

from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
print("Feature names:", iris.feature_names)
print("Target names:", iris.target_names)

Scikit-learn is built using three main libraries:
numpys: it helps work with numbers
pandas: it helps work with tables
matplotlib: it helps work with charts

Together they support sklearn



whats inside scikit library
there are \
datasets - load_iris()
preprocessing - standardScaler() // helps clean/prepare data
model_selection - train_test_split() //it helps split the data for traing and testing
metrics- accuracy_score() //measures model accuracy
linear_model - LinearRegression()     //has models like linear and logestic regression 
tree,svm - DecisionTreeClassifier()
