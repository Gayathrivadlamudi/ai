scikit-learn has tools for machine learning
linear regresion is for predicting numbers
logestic regression is for predicting categories
DecisionTree → for splitting rules
SVM → for margins
KNN → for neighbors
RandomForest → many trees together
Each model is a tool designed to solve a specific type of problem

why linear regresssion
because in real world many prblms require predicting numbers
like for
house price prediction
temperature
salary
student marks
stock values


Why Logistic Regression exists
Many real-world problems require predicting categories, not numbers:
Is the email spam or not spam? (yes/no)
Is the flower iris-setosa, iris-versicolor, iris-virginica? (3 classes)
Will a customer buy a product? (yes/no)
Linear regression cannot do this because it predicts real numbers.
So scikit-learn provides:
👉 LogisticRegression()
which predicts:
class A or class B
class 0, 1, or 2
